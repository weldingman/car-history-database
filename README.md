# Car History Database  

## ðŸ“š Overview  
The **Car History Database** is a web-based application designed to store and retrieve detailed car histories. The goal is to provide users with reliable and accessible information about a vehicle's past, including repairs, ownership, and damage records.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Search by VIN:** Look up vehicle information using its unique Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).  
- **Repair History:** Record and view detailed logs of repairs and maintenance.  
- **Ownership Tracking:** Store historical ownership data.  
- **Damage Records:** Document accidents and rebuilds.  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express.js)  
- **Database:** MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM)  
- **Frontend:** React.js (or a simple HTML/JS UI for now)  
- **Version Control:** GitHub  

## ðŸ“‹ Project Plan  
### Week 1: Initial Setup  
- Set up the Node.js environment.  
- Create basic server structure and routes.  
- Design initial database schema.  

### Week 2: Core Features  
- Implement VIN-based search functionality.  
- Develop repair and damage logging API endpoints.  

### Week 3: Frontend Prototype  
- Create a simple UI for searching and displaying car data.  
- Integrate with the backend APIs.  

### Week 4: Testing and Documentation  
- Write unit tests for API endpoints.  
- Document API usage and deployment instructions.
